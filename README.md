### Hi there, welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thielly and I'm 23 years old, almost all of them venturing into the internet. Despite having had a passion for programming since I was a child, it was only during the pandemic that I started to dedicate myself completely to it.

Currently I take small steps to be a front-end, but I intend to be a full stack programmer.
